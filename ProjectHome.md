Using low level sockets to implement a very simple version of the BATMAN ad-hoc networking algorithm. Bad programming style abounds, but it does contain some useful information re: python and raw sockets. This program uses a custom wire protocol, not UDP or TCP.

I'm putting this up for reference only, this project will not be maintained.
